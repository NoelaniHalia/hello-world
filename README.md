# hello-world

My name is Noelani Ramon and I'm 14 years old. I'm at home currently because of the coronavirus. I decided to do something during these weeks to benefit not only my present but also my future. I'm sitting at the top of my class with a 4.0 unwieghted and 4.143 wieghted GPA. I'm interested in game design and in video animation.
